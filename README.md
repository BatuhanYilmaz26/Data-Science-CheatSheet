Hello there! <br>
Welcome to my learning journey!(Learning never ends.) <br>
In this repository you can see the notebooks that I created from my lectures, from a great book called "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras and TensorFlow second edition" which I've learned tons of valuable information about the field of Data Science, Machine Learning, Deep Learning and much more.
